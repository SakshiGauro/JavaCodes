# MyAge
Refer to your code from the previous My Age exercise. Modify it using the Scanner class to take user input instead of hard coding in your age.

For reference, the instructions are listed below again. Remember to use user input instead of hard coding a value for ```age``` this time.

Using only one variable called ```age```  and the increment and decrement operators, produce the output for your current and upcoming age next year.
Sample output:
```
Please enter your current age:
My current age is: 14
My age next year will be: 15
My current age is: 14
```
