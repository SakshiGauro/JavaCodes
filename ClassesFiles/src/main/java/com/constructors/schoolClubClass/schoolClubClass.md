# SchoolClubClass
We are going to use the Student class that we completed in the last exercise and add a new `SchoolClub` class. Start by copying over your `Student` class from the last exercise.

After that, add the constructor for the `SchoolClub` class. For this class, your constructor should take a `Student` object for the leader and a `String` club name (in that order). You should also initialize the number of members at zero in the constructor.

Test your code with the `StudentTester` class. This is the same as the last exercise, so you will need to add a statement to create a club and then print it out.
