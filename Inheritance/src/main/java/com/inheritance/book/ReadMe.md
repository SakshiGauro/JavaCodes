# Books
For this activity, you are going to refactor the `Book` superclass and the `Dictionary` and `Fiction` subclasses.

Right now, the `Book` class is empty and the `Dictionary` and `Fiction` classes have instance variables and getter and setter methods. Your task is to move common attributes and methods to the `Book` superclass and remove them from the subclasses.

Note: You do not need a constructor in any class.
