# Squares
In this exercise, we are going to model some behaviors of a square. Since the `Square` object extends the `Rectangle` object, we see that a lot of the information we need is stored in the superclass and we will need to access it using the `super` keyword.

Your job is to complete the `Square` class, as specified within the class. Upon completion, thoroughly test out your code using the `SquareTester` class.
