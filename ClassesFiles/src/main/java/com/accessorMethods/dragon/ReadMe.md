# Dragon
Write a class called `Dragon`. A `Dragon` should have a level and an attack. The class should have getter methods for each of these variables.

The Dragon’s level is an integer. The Dragon’s attack is a String.

`Dragon` will also need a constructor, getters, and an attack method.

The constructor should take the level as the first argument, and the attack as the second argument.

You should create two getter (accessor) methods called `getAttack()` and `getLevel()`.

You should also create a method called `fight()`. This method should return a string that repeats the attack string once for each level. For example, if the attack string is “>” , and the level is 6, then `fight()` would return `>>>>>>`

In summary, you should have the following methods:

- A constructor that takes two parameters - the level and attack (in that order)
- getAttack
- getLevel
- fight
