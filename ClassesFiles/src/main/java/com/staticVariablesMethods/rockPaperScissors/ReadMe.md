#Rock Paper Scissors
In this problem, you’ll play a simple rock, paper, scissors
game. First, you’ll ask the user to pick rock, paper, or
scissors.

Then, you’ll have the computer randomly choose one of the
options. You should use the `Randomizer` class that you created in the last exercise to help the computer make a choice.

After that, print out the winner! You should keep playing the game until the user hits enter.

Note: You’ll need to implement a method called
`String getWinner(String user, String computer)` that determines whether the user or computer won the game, and return the correct winner!

Here is a sample run of the program.
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors):
rock
User: rock
Computer: rock
Tie
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors):
paper
User: paper
Computer: rock
User wins!
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors):
Thanks for playing!
