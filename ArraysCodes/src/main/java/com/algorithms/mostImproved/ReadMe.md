# Most Improved
In this exercise, complete the method `getMostImprovedStudent` in the `Classroom` class, as well as the method `getExamRange` in the `Student` class.

The most improved student is the one with the largest exam score range.

To compute the exam score range, you must subtract the minimum exam score from the maximum exam score.

For example, if the exam scores were 90, 75, and 84, the range would be 90 - 75 = 15.

The `toString` method in the `Student` class will print the student names with their respective grade levels. Then print who the most improved student was after this.

Sample output:
```
Ada Lovelace is in grade: 12
Alan Turing is in grade: 11
The most improved student is Ada Lovelace
