# Instruments
In this exercise, you are going to build a hierarchy to create instrument objects. We are going to create part of the orchestra using three classes, `Instrument`, `Wind`, and `Strings`. Note that the `Strings` class has a name very close to the `String` class, so be careful with your naming convention!

We need to save the following characteristics:

- Name and family should be saved for all instruments
- We need to specify whether a strings instrument uses a bow 
- We need to specify whether a wind instrument uses a reed

Build the classes out with getters and setters for all classes. Only the superclass needs a toString and the toString should print like this:
`Violin is a member of the Strings family.`

Your constructors should be set up to match the objects created in the `InstrumentTester` class.
