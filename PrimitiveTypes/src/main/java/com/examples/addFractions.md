# AddFractions
In this program you will initialize 4 integers that represent each part of two fractions, namely the numerator and denominator of the first fraction and the numerator and denominator of the second fraction.

Your program should add the two fractions and print out the result.

For example, a sample program run might look like this
```
The numerator of the first fraction is 1
The denominator of the first fraction is 2
The numerator of the second fraction is 2
The denominator of the second fraction is 5
The sum of 1/2 + 2/5 = 9/10
```
Note: you do not need to reduce these fractions. Be sure to test your code for postive and negative integers by changing the values of your initialized variables.

Remember, if you have two fractions you add them with:
```

     a         c        ad + bc
    ___   +   ___    =   ______
     b         d           bd
```
