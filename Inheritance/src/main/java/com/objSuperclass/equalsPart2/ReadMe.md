#Equals? - Part 2
In this second exercise, we are going to look at the impact of overriding the `equals` and `toString` methods.

Start by copying over your `TestEquals` class from the previous exercise. You will not need to make any changes to this code.

Instead, you are going to add the following methods to your `Ball` class:
```
public String toString()
public boolean equals(Ball other)
```
