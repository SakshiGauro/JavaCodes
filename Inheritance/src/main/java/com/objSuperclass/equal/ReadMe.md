#Equal?
For this exercise, you are given 3 `Object` class objects and 3 Ball `class` objects. In theory, all three `Objects` are the same and all 3 `Ball` objects are the same, but based on the way they are created and the way that Java evaluates equality, not all three objects will be equal.

Your task is to start by printing out the 6 `Object` and `Ball` objects. Remember, the `Object` class has a toString and since a `Ball` object extends the `Object` class, we should see similarities between the `Object` and `Ball` class.

After printing them out, you should notice which objects are the same. Write 2 true and false statements for each group, one using == and one using .equals. Will these be the same?
