# Set Scores
Create a score program that prints out an array called `scores`:
```
int[] scores = {80, 95, 82, 67, 100};
```
After printing the first time, update the 3rd and last scores to 72 and 95, respectively. Reset them in the code without changing the original array declaration and then print the new set of scores.

Your output should look as follows:
```
80
95
82
67
100

80
95
72
67
95
```
