# Snap Shot Splash Screen
A splash screen is a quick, simple graphic or text that usually appears while a game or program is launching.

You need to make a splash screen for your Snap Shot app and a separate pop up to upgrade to your premium app.

Create one array that contains the `Strings` for the Welcome splash screen and print it out.

Then, without modifying the original array declaration or creating a new array, change the first and last elements by resetting the values of the original array.

Your output should look as follows:
```
Welcome
to
the snap shot
app!

Upgrade
to
the snap shot
premium app!
```
