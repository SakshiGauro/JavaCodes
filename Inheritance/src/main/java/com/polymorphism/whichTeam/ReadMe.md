# Which Team?
For this exercise, you are given a `Team` superclass with a `BaseballTeam` and `FootballTeam` subclass. Take a moment to examine these classes and the instance variables and methods in each.

In the TeamTester class, you will see three objects declared and instantiated using the `Team`, `FootballTeam`, or `BaseballTeam` classes.

For each object, print out all available information that you can get from the getters or the toString.

**Hint:** Remember, for the program to compile and run, Java looks for methods to exist in certain classes.
