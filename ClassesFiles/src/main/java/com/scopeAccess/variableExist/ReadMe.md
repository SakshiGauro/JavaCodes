# Which Variables Exists?
The given `MathOperations` class has several methods to perform mathematical operations.

The class has its own instance variables, and each method has its own local variables and parameters.

Your job is to print out the variables that exist inside each method, and the value of each of those variables. Each time the comment `// PRINT OUT VARIABLES HERE` appears in the code, write a print statement for each variable that is in scope.

An example has been provided in the `sum` function.
