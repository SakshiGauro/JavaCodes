# Fraction Math
For this exercise, we have created a static class called `FractionMath` that will handle adding and multiplying fractions.

We are going to use this static class as we build out a new `Fraction` class. Your job is to complete the `Fraction` class based on the structure that is set up. To do this, you will need to use the `this` notation in your constructor and setters. You will also need to use it to pass the object to the `FractionMath` class.

The tester is complete and can be used to test your objects. Feel free to make changes in this class to test other things.
