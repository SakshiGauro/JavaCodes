# Player
We have constructed a `Player` Class for you.

###Add the following:
- **public static** variable:
    ```
    int totalPlayers
    ```
    Static variable should be an `int`. The value should be incremented whenever a new `Player` is constructed.


- **public static** variable:
    ```
    int maxPlayers
    ```
    Static variable should be an `int`. Set its value to 10.


- **public static** method:
    ```
    gameFull()
    ```
    The `gameFull()` static method should return a `boolean` of whether the total players is greater than or equal to the `maxPlayers` static variable.
