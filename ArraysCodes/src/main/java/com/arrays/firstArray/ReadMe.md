# Out First Array
Letâ€™s make our first arrays!

Create 3 arrays as described below:

- A `String` array to hold the names of the cities Las Vegas, Minsk, and Sao Paulo


- An `int` array that holds the average yearly high temperatures of each city in Fahrenheit:
    
    -Las Vegas: 104 degrees
    
    -Minsk: 73
    
    -Sao Paulo: 80


- A `double` array that holds the average yearly precipitation for each city in inches:

    -Las Vegas: 4.17 inches

    -Minsk: 26.7
    
    -Sao Paulo: 55.0

Make sure you keep the array elements in the same order so that the same index can be used to get corresponding cities, temps, and precipitation. These are called parallel arrays.

Then print out a table that displays each city with its corresponding average high temp and annual precipitation.

#### OUTPUT:
```
Las Vegas has an average annual precipitation of 4.17 inches.
Las Vegas has an average annual high temp of 104 degrees Fahrenheit.
Minsk has an average annual precipitation of 26.7 inches.
Minsk has an average annual high temp of 73 degrees Fahrenheit.
Sao Paulo has an average annual precipitation of 55.0 inches.
Sao Paulo has an average annual high temp of 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
