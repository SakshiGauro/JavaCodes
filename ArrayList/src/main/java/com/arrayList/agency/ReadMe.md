# Initializing an ArrayList
An ad agency is interested in keeping track of their clients a little more easily.

Help them out by creating two ArrayLists:

1. Create an ArrayList called `companyName` that stores an ArrayList of all the company names.
2. Create an `Integer` ArrayList called `contractValue` that stores the value of the contract that the ad agency has with its clients.
