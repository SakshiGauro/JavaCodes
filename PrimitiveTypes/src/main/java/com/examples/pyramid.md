# Pyramid
Write a program that estimates how much Kufu’s pyramid in Giza weighs.

Your program should assume that every block weighs 2.5 tons. Kufu’s pyramid in Giza used around 2,500,000 blocks.

You should use two variables, **numBlocks** and **blockWeight**, to calculate the weight.

Here is an example output for a pyramid that uses 150,000 blocks:
```
The pyramid weighs 375000.0 tons
```
Note: Your number should be different!
