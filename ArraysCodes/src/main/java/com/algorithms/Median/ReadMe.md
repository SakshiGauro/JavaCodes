# Find the Median
Write a method called `median` that returns the median value in the array.

If the length of the array is odd, the median is the value in the center of the array.

If the length of the array is even, the median is the average of the two numbers in the center.

You may assume the array passed into this method will never be empty.

Sample output:
```
The median value of the EVEN array is 19.5
The median value of the ODD array is 22.0
```
Hint: Weâ€™ve imported `java.util.*` for you, so you have a handy static method on Arrays that you can use called `Arrays.sort` so you can sort your method BEFORE finding the median.
