# Pies
For this exercise, we are going to revisit the `Pie` superclass that we saw as an example in the last lesson. We have added the `Pumpkin` class, which takes the number of slices and a boolean to indicate if it is made with canned pumpkin. We also added a `getType()` method in the Pie class.

For this exercise, you need to create either an Array or an ArrayList and add 3 pies to that list, an `Apple`, a `Pumpkin`, and a third type using the `Pie` class.

After adding these to your list, loop through and print out the type using the `getType()` method in the pie class.

###Sample Output
```
Pie: Pumpkin
Pie: Apple
Pie: Blueberry
```
