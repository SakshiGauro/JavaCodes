# Find the Last Multiple
Write a method called `findMultipleOfThree` that returns the index of the last value in the array that is a multiple of 3. If no index of 3 exists, return -1.

For example, in the array
```
[4, 7, 9, 7, 12]
```
the last multiple of three is ‘12’, which occurs at index 4.

Sample output:
```
The following index holds the LAST multiple of 3: 4
```
