# Food App Demo
You have been hired by your favorite restaurant to create a food nutrition app for their customers to use.  Before you get too far, the owner wants you to create a quick prototype.

Your app should output a food name and the number of calories, then ask the customer how many they want. You need to ask them for 3 menu items. Once they tell you the quantity for the three menu items, you will output the mealâ€™s total calories.

Behind the scenes, you are going to create a `Food` class. Your `Food` class should use `name` and `calories` in the constructor (in that order!). You should create getters and setters for these variables. You also need a `toString` method that will be used in the line before you ask for the quantity.

In addition to the `Food` class, you will have a `FoodRunner` class where you will have your main method. In here, you will create your three foods and ask for the quantities. After that, you can use the quantities to calculate and output the total.

### Sample output:
```
Hamburgers have 600 calories.
How many would you like?
2

French Fries have 350 calories.
How many would you like?
1

Coke have 200 calories.
How many would you like?
2

Your meal will have a total of 1950 calories
