# Electric Cars
With the addition of electric cars, we have a need to create a subclass of our `Car` class. In this exercise, we are going to create the `Electric Car` subclass so that we can override the miles per gallon calculation since electric cars donâ€™t use gallons of gas.

The `Car` class is complete, but you need to complete the `ElectricCar` class as outlined in the starter code with comments.

Once complete, use the `CarTester` to create both a `Car` and `ElectricCar` object and test these per the instructions in the `CarTester` class.
