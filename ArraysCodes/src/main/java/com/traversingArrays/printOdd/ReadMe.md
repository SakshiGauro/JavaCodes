# Print Odd Array Indices
Here we have a program that creates an integer array. Fill in the method `printOddIndices` to print out just the elements stored at the odd indices of the array.

For example, the following code:
```
int[] arr = new int[] {10, 20, 30, 40};
printOddIndices(arr);
```
Should print out:
```
20
40
```
Because the odd indices in `arr` are 1 and 3, and index 1 stores the value 20 and index 3 stores the value 40.
