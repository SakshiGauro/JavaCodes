# Scope
For this exercise, you are going to complete the `printScope()` method in the `Scope` class. Then you will create a `Scope` object in the `ScopeTester` and call the `printScope`.

The method will print the name of each variable in the `Scope` class, as well as its corresponding value. There are 5 total variables in the `Scope` class, some of which can be accessed directly as instance variable, others of which need to be accessed via their getter methods.

For any variable that can be accessed directly, use the variable name. Otherwise, use the getter method.

### Sample Output:
The output of the `printScope` method should look like this:
```
a = 5
b = 10
c = 15
d = 20
e = 25
```
