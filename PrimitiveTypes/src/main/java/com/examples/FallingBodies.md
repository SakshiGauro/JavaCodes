# FallingBodies
A free fall is when an object is falling freely with no forces acting upon it except gravity, which is a defined constant called **g = 9.8 m/s^2**. The distance the object falls (height in meters) is 1/2 gravity times the square of the time falling. Velocity (meters per second) is defined as gravity * time. The formulas are given below. Remember, you can get t^2 by multiplying t * t.

**h = .5 * g * t^2**

**v = g * t**

Use **g** as a final variable to solve the following problems in Java.

1. You’re standing at the edge of a cliff and drop a ball. It takes 10 sec to hit the ground. How high up are you? In other words, what’s the height of the cliff?
2. What is the velocity of the ball when it hits the ground?

Print the height and then the velocity. Format your answers so that the numbers have units and meaning in a sentence.

Once you get your program working properly, try to reset the final **g** variable and the **t** variable to something different before you do the calculations in the formulas in your program. What happens in each case?
