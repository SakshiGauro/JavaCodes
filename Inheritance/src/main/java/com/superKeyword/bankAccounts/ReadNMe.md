# Bank Accounts
For this exercise, you will be completing the `Account` class, which simulates a regular bank account, then using overrides and calls to the superclass to create a `StudentAccount`.

Student accounts differ from regular accounts in that they get a bonus $1 for every deposit, but a $2 fee for every withdrawal. You will override the methods in the `StudentAccount` by calling the superclass methods with the additonal amount or fee incorporated since the balance is not directly stored in the `StudentAccount` object.

You will also update the toString, as outlined in the comments.

When completed, create one student account and one regular account for testing. Deposit and withdraw money and print the results.
