# Employees
In this problem, you are going to create an `Employee` superclass and an `HourlyEmployee` subclass.

The `Employee` class will hold the employeeâ€™s name and annual salary. You should have getters for both instance variables, but only a setter for the salary.

In the `HourlyEmployee` class, you will add an hours instance variable as well as a method to set and get the hourly salary. You are not storing the hourly salary, but rather converting it to an annual salary.

To convert an houlry salary to an annual salary, multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours per week and then by 52. You will need to do the reverse to get the hourly salary.

Both classes should have a toString and examples are in the starter code.

Be sure to test your classes in the `EmployeeTester` class!
