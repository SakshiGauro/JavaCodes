# Find Index of a String
In this exercise, you will need to create a static method called `findString` in the `MatchingString` class that should iterate over `String[] arr` looking for the exact match of the `String` that is passed as a parameter.

Return the `index` of the array where the `String` is found; if it does not exist in the array, return -1.

For example, if the word “Karel” is passed in, your method would return 1.
