# Explore Selection Sort
In this exercise, we will be looking at our example code for Selection Sort.

However, while we are sorting we will also count the number of swaps taking place, then print them out once the array has been sorted.

Add a print statement at the end of the selectionSort method that prints out the number of swaps that took place during the sort.

You should not modify the `main()` method.

Hint: Where are items compared? Try writing out the steps in the algorithm on paper to help.
