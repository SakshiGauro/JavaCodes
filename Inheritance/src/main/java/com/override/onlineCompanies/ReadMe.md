# Online Companies
There are many different types of companies out there so trying to make one class that fits them all would be a challenge. We are going to take a look at modeling out a general company with the `Company` class and then customize that class with the `OnlineCompany` subclass.

The basic structure is set up for both of these classes. Your task is to complete these classes as specified in the comments of each class.

Once complete, use the `CompanyTester` class to create a `Company` and `OnlineCompany` object, then print each out using the toString().
