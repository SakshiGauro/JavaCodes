# StudentOverLoad
We are going to use the Student class and complete it by writing a two constructors (overloading the constructor).

The first constructor should take first name, last name, grade, and school, then set all the instance variables accordingly.

The second constructor should take first name, last name, and grade. Set all 4 instance variables, but for school, set it generically to high school, middle school, or elementary as follows:

- Grades 9-12 - high school
- Grades 6-8 - middle school
- All others - elementary school

You should also update the `toString` method to include “and goes to” and the school level that the `Student` goes to.
