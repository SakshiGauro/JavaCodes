# CastingToDouble
Write a program that:

1. Asks the user for two integers called `int1` and `int2`
2. Divides the two `ints`
3. Prints the result

The trick here is that we want the division of the two `int`s to result in a `double`! Casting values to `double`s will be necessary to solve this exercise.

Here is a sample run of the solution:
```
First Int: 3
Second Int: 4
0.750
```
**NOTE:** Your job is to print the division of the two `int`s as a `double`.
