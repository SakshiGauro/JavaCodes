# More Animals!
For this exercise, you are going to create a part of an `Animal` hierarchy. Unlike some of our examples and the previous exercises, this exercise is going to have 3 levels in the hierachry.

At the top is the `Animal` class. Below that, we are going to have a subclass for `Pets`. Under pets, we are going to have 2 subclasses, `Dogs` and `Fish`.

You will need to create your class hierarchy and add instance variables, getters, and setter methods to accommodate the following information:

- I need to save what type of animal I have (String variable)
- I want to be able to save a name for my fish and dog (String variable)
- I want to know which fish need salt water v. fresh water (String variable)
- I want to know if my dog has been trained (boolean variable)
- I want to know the size of my dog and fish (String variable)

Make sure you use common sense names for your variables!
