# Tic Tac Toe Board
Create a `TicTacToe` class that initializes a 3x3 board of `"-"` values. We will use this class in future exercises to fully build out a Tic Tac Toe game!

The `TicTacToe` class should have a 2D array as an instance variable and a constructor that initializes the 2D array with the `"-"` value.

Add a getter method that returns the private 2D instance variable.
