# Answering questions
In this exercise, we’ve started to declare some variables but we don’t know the answers to the questions. You should fill in the rest of the lines to make them correct.
```
String myName = "";
int luckyNumber = /* you fill in */;
double ...
boolean ...
```
Edit the code so that the output of running the program is:
```
Karel the Dog
11
75.3
true
```
