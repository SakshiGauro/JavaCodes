# DogClass
For this exercise, you are going to complete the `Dog` class. The structure has been set up for you, but you will need to complete two constructors (overloaded).

The first will take three parameters and assign the values to the instance variables. The method signature should take the name, then age, and finally weight.

The second constructor will only take name then age. For this one, you will assign a value of 0.0 to the dogâ€™s weight.

Once complete, create and print two `Dog` objects in the `DogTester` class. The first should use three parameters and the second should only use two paramters.

Sample Output:
```
Name: Karel
Weight: 15.6
Age: 7
Name: Clover
Weight: 0.0
Age: 9
```
