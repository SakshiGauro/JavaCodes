# Activity
You need to comment the `ActivityTracker` and add JavaDocs for the `ActivityLog` class.

Add at least 7 comments to your code to document the different steps that are happening. You can use either single line or multi-line comments, but you should include enough information so that a person not familiar with the code can understand what the `ActivityTracker` class is doing.

Add JavaDoc style comments to the constructor and each method in the `ActivityLog`. Remember, you should start with a short description of the method, then use `@param` or `@return` to document any parameters or return values for the program.
