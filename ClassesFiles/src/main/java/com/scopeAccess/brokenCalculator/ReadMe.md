# Broken Calculator
For this exercise, we are going to take a look at an alternate `Calculator` class, but this one is broken. There are several scope issues in the calculator class that are preventing it from running.

Your task is to fix the `Calculator` class so that it runs and prints out the correct results. The `CalculatorTester` is completed and should function correctly once you fix the `Calculator` class.
