# Car Class
You are going to create a Car class to simulate how far a car can drive on a road trip. To do this, you will need to complete both the `Car` and the `CarTester` classes.

For the `Car` class, you will use the following variables and methods:

**Instance Variables:**
```
private double efficiency // this is miles per gallon
private double gas
private double tankCapacity
private double totalMilesDriven

```
**Constructor:**
```
public Car(double carEfficiency, double carTankCapacity)
```

**Methods:**
```
* public void addGas()- this method should fill the car with gas up to the tank capacity. The method should print `Filling up ...`

* public void addGas(double amount) - This should add amount to the tank. If the amount is greater than the capacity, set the gas to 
the tank capacity. The method should print `Adding gas ...`

* public double getTotalMilesDriven() - returns the number of miles the car has driven

* public void drive(double distance) - checks if car can drive that number of miles, and then adds miles to totalMilesDriven and 
subtracts the amount of gas needed to go those miles. The method should print `Driving [distance]` or, if the distance is too far, it should print `Can't drive [distance]. That's too far!`

* public boolean canDrive (double distance) - returns true if the car has gas

* public double milesAvailable() - returns how many more miles the car could drive

* public double getGas() - returns the amount of gas left
```
  In creating both the `Car` and `CarTester`, be sure to check the sample output to guide your design considerations. You will need to have a conditional statement in the `drive` method to determine if you can drive the correct distance.

Also, make sure you check that you donâ€™t over fill the gas tank!

### Sample Output:
```
Filling up ...
Miles available: 300.0
Driving 100.0
Miles available: 200.0
Adding gas ...
Miles available: 260.0
Can't drive 1000.0. That's too far!
Driving 200.0
Gas remaining: 3.0
Total Miles Driven: 300.0
```
