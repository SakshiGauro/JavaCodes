# Baseball
The **BaseballPlayer** class stores the number of hits and the number of at-bats a player has.

You will complete this class by writing the constructor. Write a method called:
```
public BaseballPlayer()
```
The constructor should take three parameters to match the three instance variables in the class and then initialize the instance variables with these parameters.

The parameters should be ordered so that the name of the baseball player is input first, then their hits, and at bats.

In the **BaseballTester** class, print a call to **printBattingAverage** to test your constructor.
