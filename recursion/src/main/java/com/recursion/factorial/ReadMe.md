#Factorial
For this problem, you are goign to write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. Remember, factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it. This function should be similar to the summing example we looked at earlier.

_Note: Make sure you enter small numbers to test. Factorial will overflow the int value very quickly!_
