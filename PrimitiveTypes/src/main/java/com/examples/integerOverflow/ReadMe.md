# IntegerOverflow
If an expression would evaluate to an `int` value outside of the allowed range, an integer overflow occurs. This could result in an incorrect value within the allowed range.

In this program you will test for _underflow_ and _overflow_ in Java by adding 1 to the maximum value and subtracting 1 from the minimum value to see what happens to the output. Your output should include 4 items:

- The minimum value for an integer.
- The maximum value for an integer.
- The minimum value subtracted by 1.
- The maximum value with 1 added.

What do the last two lines print out? Did this surprise you? What do you think it happening here?

**NOTE: Refer back to the previous example on Min and Max Values of Integers if you need to.**
