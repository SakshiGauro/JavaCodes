# Computers
For this exercise, you are going to design 3 classes:

- `Computer` - Superclass
- `Laptop` - Subclass
- `Desktop` - Subclass

You will design these classes to optimize the superclass/subclass relationship by creating instance variables and getter/setter methods.

Include the following instance variables:

- `int screenSize` - Inches of monitor space
- `int memory` - GB of ram
- `double batteryLife` - Hours of battery life
- `boolean monitor` - Whether or not a monitor is included

**Each class should have at least one variable in it.**

Once completed, the Tester class should execute without error.
