# Classroom Array
In this exercise, use the `Student` class to print out each student using a `for-each` loop with their first name, last name and grade level.

You will need to finish the class with the appropriate getter (accessor) methods for last name and grade level.

You **must** print in the for each loop, and **NOT** use the `toString` method in the class.

Output:
```
Julian Jones is in grade 9
Larisa Torres is in grade 10
Amada Robin is in grade 10
Mikka Leads is in grade 9
Jay Khalil is in grade 10
Julian Jones is in grade: 9
